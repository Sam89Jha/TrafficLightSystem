# TrafficLightSystem
Summary: At XAM we hire the top 5% of engineers across the globe. So, we must ensure that we are
hiring top people and this test is a part of that, I’m sure you would appreciate that the peers you are
working with are tested and ensured to be top calibre. This test involves you creating a sample
application to industry best practice based on the requirements below. The great thing about the
traffic light problem is that its small but also complex in regard to state and real-time. It’s a real
opportunity for great engineers to shine. To work with the best then it’s worth taking the effort to
complete this assessment and show us what you can do.
Definition:
In this test we would like you to implement a traffic light system. We are required to have 2 sets of
lights, as follows.
Lights 1: Traffic is travelling south
Lights 2: Traffic is travelling west
The lights in which traffic is travelling on the same axis can be green at the same time. During normal
hours all lights stay green for 20 seconds, but during peak times north and south lights are green for
40 seconds while west and east are green for 10 seconds. Peak hours are 0800 to 1000 and 1700 to
1900. Yellow lights are shown for 5 seconds before red lights are shown. Red lights stay on until the
cross-traffic is red for at least 4 seconds, once a red light goes off then the green is shown for the
required time(eg the sequence is reset).
Implementation/Outcomes:
1. Implement in the technology that you like front-end or backend (you can use ‘dotnet new’
templates of your choice)
2. There’s no need to implement entity framework (or similar) to store the data in a database,
a in-memory store is fine
3. Code needs to follow architecture &amp; best practices for enterprise grade systems
Note: Code will be evaluated not just for function, but on the quality of the code.
