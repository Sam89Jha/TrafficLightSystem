# TrafficLightSystem
Summary:

Lights 1: Traffic is travelling south
Lights 2: Traffic is travelling west
The lights in which traffic is travelling on the same axis can be green at the same time. During normal
hours all lights stay green for 20 seconds, but during peak times north and south lights are green for
40 seconds while west and east are green for 10 seconds. Peak hours are 0800 to 1000 and 1700 to
1900. Yellow lights are shown for 5 seconds before red lights are shown. Red lights stay on until the
cross-traffic is red for at least 4 seconds, once a red light goes off then the green is shown for the
required time(eg the sequence is reset)
